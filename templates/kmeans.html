<h1>K-Means Clustering</h1>
<p>
	A clustering technique which assigns observations to
	clusters based on distance from the cluster center. Observations are assigned
	to the cluster whose center is the shortest distance from the observation.
	Clusters are chosen which minimize the distance from each observation to it's
	cluster's center
</p>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<p>
	Start with k random points, treat these as the cluster centers.
	Assign each observation a cluster. Recompute cluster centers and reassign
	observations. Repeat until total distance from centers stops changing and
	record results. Repeat whole process N times, and select result with lowest
	sum of distances from centres.
</p>
<h2>Model Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Distance Measure: Euclidean</li>
	<li>Center: Mean</li>
	<li>Number of Clusters: <span class="no-of-clusters"></span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Algorithm Parameters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Number of Iterations(N): 300</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
	K-Means does a good job on isotropic clusters with similar variance.
	Performs poorly with clusters that have irregular shapes and varying variances.
	Different measures of distance (Manhattan, Cosine, etc.) and different
	measures of center (mean, median, etc.) can be used to define relationships.
